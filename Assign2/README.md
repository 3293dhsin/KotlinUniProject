# Assignment 2

In this assignment, we were tested on our programming logic and get familiarised with Android Porgramming in Kotlin. We learned about the concept of string externalisation. We also learned how to manage UI event listeners and device rotation, create AlertDialogBox and use HashMap to store data.
