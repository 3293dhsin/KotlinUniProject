Assignment 4: In this assignment, we learned to use material design componenets such as CardView widget, Staggered GridLayout and Tabbed Layout. We also learned how to read text file and retrieve the data from it in Kotlin. Besides, we set up a HTTP web server using Xampp and send a HTTP request using the Retrofit to retrieve data and Glide library to load the images.
